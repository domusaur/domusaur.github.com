title: "character continuity in imaginary worlds"
---

I'm sure you've done this too: while trying to fall asleep, I tell myself some stories with lots of characters and mutiple timelines and years worth of important events that happen to those characters. But what happens when you take those characters and move them to a different world?

For this post I'm gonna try to keep my syntax amd spelling and capitalization and grammar in check cause i have lots of things to say about this, but please excuse me if I suddenly start rambling forever in lower case like i'm doing right now. Ok sorry.

The thing is that sometimes my characters have a reason to be in a story, and oher times the story just happens to my characters. I often keep one or two characters with really distinct personalities to use as vessels in my bedtime stories. Not as a self insert, more like an avatar, someone to live vicariously through for a while each day.

However, a problem arises when I change the world they inhabit. They're characters of their own, so what happens when I move them to another world? Do they lose all their memories and progress and start over? Do they simply react as if they just moved to a different country? What happens if I have the same character in two places at the same time? Which one is "canon" and whichone is the alternative universe?  
These are the questions that keep me up at night and sometimes prevent me from enjoying my time in my imaginary worlds.

I'm asking these questions cause I just came up with a world that can host all my hyperfixations and let me experience everything I want at once. But that makes me question what would happen to the previous world.

In any case, I'll continue to experiment with this and see what happens. Worst thing that can happen is that I end up with multiple instances of the same characters existing at once with slight differences. The more the merrier I guess! I love my characters and would do anything to make them happy.  
Now I want to continue developing these tiny worlds, I will need them. I spoke to my therapist about escapism and all that and they said it's ok for me to escape into my head for a while if reality gets too heavy, which means multiple times a day.

That's something else to keep in mind with all this. I sometimes accidentally slip into my other world while I'm trying to get things done. If you're going to create a tiny head world keep in mind that you might start detaching yourself from "real" reality. This is not a problem for me in the sense that I don't really care in which plane of existence I am, but it might become a problem for you.

I started rambling a bit there so I'm gonna stop typing now. Thank you for reading this and have a great day!
