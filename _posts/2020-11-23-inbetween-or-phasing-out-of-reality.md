title: getting stuck in the in-between -or phasing in and out of reality
---

I already talked about one of the problems that arises when traveling to a tiny world, so now I'm gonna talk about the kind of problem that follows me afterwards.

Sometimes after coming back from my tiny worlds and into real reality, I don't come back fully, but instead get stuck in between the two. This manifests as feeling "blurry"; I can't process what's in front of me, my thoughts go back and forth between what I'm trying to do and what I was doing in the other world, and sometimes images from the other world are "projected" between my eyes and the rest of the world as if a transparent screen was present. This way I'm not fully in neither of the two worlds in question, and it really affects my ability to focus and my productivity levels, as I get stuck in "auto-pilot".

If this also happens to you, you might be asking  
##How do can I stop this from happening?  
This is a complex subject, so the answer is also complex and I'm pretty sure I don't have it just yet, but here are a few ideas:

###Create routines and rituals  
If you've suffered from insomnia like I did for many years, you might have already heard this one. The premise is that you create routines, or "rituals", that make it so that your brain starts recognizing when it is appropiate to phase out to another reality. You can train your brain to only do this when you're doing a specific activity, or when you're hearing a specific sound, etc. Be careful with how you set this one up though, as specific things can become triggers and then you could accidentally slip into other realities.

###Ground yourself  
This one sounds silly at first, but once you know the logic behind it, it can be a very powerful tool. Grounding is the act of releasing engergy (it can be mental energy) out of your body, as if you were a lightning rod conducting the electricity of the sky into the earth to disipate it and neutralize it. Take those thoughts of worry for your worldly presence and release them, find something to focus on, such as shuffling cards or solving a rubik cube, and do that until your thoughts are all in a little row and you can find them easily. This one is probably the hardest part, as it can take a lot of mental energy to bring your mind back into this reality.

###Document the journey  
Keeping a diary/journal of your mental state can be very helpful when dealing with this. You can document your feelings, thoughts, anxiety, activities, and that can help you find out when you're most likely to slip out of reality. If you can figure this out you will be able to favor the activities and situations that make it easier for you to be in your desired state of mind (you might want to avoid slipping out at a family dinner, for example). This will take you some time and effort, but it will give you good results if you're dilligent.  
I like to keep a diary for my imaginary world and another one for my mundane life, but you can definitely keep as many or as few of them as you like. If you're worried about your privacy, you can use a service like monkkee, which is a private online diary with super strong encryption, or you can make your own secret alphabet like I did (although I've been very lazy with it and still haven't become fluent in it).

###If it becomes a bigger problem, consult with a professional  
This should go without mention, but if slipping out of reality is a persistent issue for you, it might be good to consult a professional about it, as there could be an underlying health issue present.  
Personally, I have found it very difficult to find a qualified therapist that is willing to listen to me and not treat me like I'm crazy, but now that I talked about it with my current therapist they said that it's ok to practice some escapism when life gets heavy. I'm still trying to understand why this happens and what I can do to deal with it, and it is a journey. You won't wake up one day and suddenly have complete control of which reality you inhabit by the minute, but you can work on it and around it to be more comfortable in your existence.

As for me, I don't really care if I slip out of reality at this point, reality sucks and I don't have a reason to feel tied to it.

Thank you for reading and have a nice day, NEL <3
