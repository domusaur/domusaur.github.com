If you can see this post, that means the site is working!
I don't know what i'm gonna do with this just yet but i think i'll just figure it out as we go

you might have noticed that my blog looks kinda ugly, it's cause i like it that way. lately i've been very nostalgic for things i saw online in my childhood, growing up in the 2000s. everything was blocky and flashy, good stuff. so i wanted my blog to look confy to me.
i'm already getting ideas for some graphics i could use here, ideas ideas...
i might also practice some coding here, it's been a looooong time since i stopped coding, so maybe i should give it another try!

so yeah, that's it for now. i'll add more things to this webpage as needed

thanks for visiting! sorry to bore you with my ramblings
